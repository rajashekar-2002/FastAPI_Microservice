Perfect 👍
Now let’s properly learn FastAPI microservices the RIGHT WAY, step by step, using:

✅ Two separate services

✅ Async FastAPI

✅ Best practices

✅ Service-to-service communication

✅ Simple HTML frontend

❌ No database (to keep concepts clear first)

This is first-time friendly but industry-correct.

🧠 What we are going to build
Architecture (simple microservice setup)
Browser (HTML)
   ↓
Service A (Frontend / API Gateway)
   ↓ (HTTP call)
Service B (Data Service)

Responsibilities
Service	Responsibility
Service A	Receives user request + serves HTML
Service B	Provides data (JSON API)
HTML	UI to test interaction

🔹 Service A — Frontend + Gateway

This service:

Serves HTML

Calls Service B

Combines data for UI




🔁 How services interact (VERY IMPORTANT)
Step-by-step flow

1️⃣ Browser requests / from Service A
2️⃣ Service A calls /items on Service B
3️⃣ Service B returns JSON
4️⃣ Service A renders HTML
5️⃣ Browser sees result

📌 Service B never talks to HTML
📌 Service A never owns data

🧠 Why this is the CORRECT microservice design
Rule	Followed?
Single responsibility	✅
Loose coupling	✅
HTTP communication	✅
Independent deployment	✅
Async I/O	✅
🚫 What we did NOT do (on purpose)

❌ Shared database
❌ Direct imports between services
❌ create_all
❌ Tight coupling
❌ Sync HTTP calls

🔐 Production best practices (next steps)

We didn’t add yet:

Authentication

Service discovery

Retry / timeout

Circuit breaker

Docker

But this foundation is correct.

🧠 Mental model (remember this forever)

Microservices talk via HTTP, not Python imports

🔜 What we should do next (recommended order)

1️⃣ Add Pydantic schemas
2️⃣ Add timeouts & error handling
3️⃣ Add Docker for both services
4️⃣ Add database to Service B
5️⃣ Add API Gateway pattern
6️⃣ Add JWT auth between services
